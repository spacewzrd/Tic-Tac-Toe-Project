# Tic-Tac-Toe-Project
Its a tic-tac-toe game written with css, javascript and html.Its inspired by pajama sam and the chesse and crackers game. Slightly responsive and very delicious. New game button starts a new game. Whose first button lets you choose if chesse or crackers goes first.So get a good buddy or shitty buddy, and play my game.
